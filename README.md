# The Database
The SemFi data has been extracted from [The Finnish Internet Parsebank](http://bionlp.utu.fi/finnish-internet-parsebank.html). This data has been applied in tools such as [Poem Machine](http://runokone.cs.helsinki.fi) that is used to create Finnish poetry automatically.

# The Contents of the Database
The database contains a noun and a verb table which contain syntactically related words with frequencies. There's also a frequencies table that contains the frequencies of all word forms in the corpus. 

And finally a verse structure table that contains the syntactic structures of Finnish poem verses. The around 5000 poems analyzed are the ones released in [wiki sources.](https://fi.wikisource.org/wiki/Luokka:Runot)
